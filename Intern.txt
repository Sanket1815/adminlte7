Respected ma'am.


                I went to the AdminLTE code I tried to implement it on Microsoft Visual Studio but due to some errors I could not see the application.
I tried fixing those errors. The work which I was given to go through the VIEW part of MVC(Model View Controller) so I went through the concepts of it.
I am waiting for the next conversation so that I can fix my problems and get a more knowledge of the project of the company.

Thankyou,
Sanket Nadkarni.
